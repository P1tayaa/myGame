# Godot + LDtk Integration with Default Tileset

This is my intergation of **Godot Engine** with **LDtk** using its default tileset to import and test levels.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Godot Engine** (4.3+ recommended)
- **LDtk (Level Designer Toolkit)** (latest version)
---

## Steps

### 1. Setup LDtk
1. Download and install LDtk from [ldtk.io](https://ldtk.io).
2. Open the smaple.ldtk and edit the levels
3. Save the file, but adding and changing tileset will remove the collisions in godot.

### 2. Setup Godot
1. Open the godot and Run the MainGame.tscn

---
## Notes
- It is a proof of concept and I am working on a improve version.
- Refer to the [LDtk Plugin Docs](https://github.com/deepnight/godot-ldtk-importer) for advanced features.
